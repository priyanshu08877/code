    # Also with for loop , we can execute a set of statementsmonce for each in list ,tuple ,set ,etc.

# suppose you  have a fruits list having three element "apple",  "banana" and orange and we to exit for lopp
#when value equals to "branan". So, to exit fro the loop will use 
# fruits=["apple","banana","cheery"]
# for x in fruits:
#     print(x)

# similiary we also have continue statement through which current iteration of the loop  and continue  with the next
#fruits=["apple","banana","cheery"]
#for x in fruits:
    
#    if x=="banana":
#       continue
#    print(x)
